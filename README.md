The startup Pur Beurre noticed that their users wanted to change their diet but did not know where to start. Replace Nutella with hazelnut paste, yes, but which one? And in which store to buy it? Their idea is to create a program that would interact with the Open Food Facts database to retrieve food, compare it and offer the user a healthier substitute for the food that makes him want.


Description of the user path
The user is on the terminal. The terminal shows him the following choices:

1 - Which food do you want to replace?

2 - Find my substituted foods.

The user selects 1. The program asks the user the following questions and the user selects the answers:

  .Select the category. [Several proposals associated with a number. The user enters the corresponding digit and presses enter]
  
  .Select the food. [Several proposals associated with a number. The user enters the digit corresponding to the chosen food and presses      enter]
  
  .The program offers a substitute, its description, a store where to buy it (if any) and a link to the Open Food Facts page about that food.
  
  .The user then has the possibility to save the result in the database.
  
If the user selects 2, the program displays the result of the searches already done thus avoiding to redo a search in the database.
